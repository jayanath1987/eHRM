sfXmlReporterPlugin
===================

This plugin enables the creation of complex, multi-dimensional reports (similar to those seen in Access) using XML and PHP.

The manual is [here](http://www.xmlreporter.org/docs/html)

This is Alpha software, there are sure to be bugs and missing features - if you find any missing features or bugs let me know :)

I will be adding complete examples to the manual and codebase, and an online demo soon-ish ..

Features
--------

 * Reports created by providing meta data on the required fields / lists (definitions)
 * These definitions contain XPath expressions to either the resultset or the report context
 * Any part of a report can be iterated with a resultset
 * Resultsets are generated from an XML query document
 * The query document allows independent nested queries
 * Filters enable queries to be ammended via user input
   * Add any query element to the main query depending on a user condition
   * User input through HTML widgets
   * Symfony widgets can be wrapped
 * The report document is transformed for presentation with XSLT
 * Reports are aggregated into a single project XML file
 * Documents are validated with XSD schemas
 * Uses PDO as DB layer
   * Configuration can be pulled from Propel 1.2 or 1.3 using connection strategies
   * Doctrine support should be very easy

 * Symfony module for browsing and viewing reports

 * (almost) Complete reference manual
 * Unit Tested
 * Main library decoupled from Symfony

Getting Started
---------------

    ./symfony xml-reporter:init-project your_application_name

Todo
